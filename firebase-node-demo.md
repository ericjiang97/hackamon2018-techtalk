# What is Firebase?

> Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform developed by Firebase, Inc. in 2011, then acquired by Google in 2014.
> -- Wikipedia

We are going to use Firebase Hosting in this demo

# What is ReactJS

ReactJS is a **component-based** that is used to build user-interfaces whether its for websites (Frontend) or hybrid (ElectronJS) applications

# Installing Create-React-App

CRA is a zero-configuration generator tool that can get us started up quickly

```
npm install -g create-react-app

# or if you are using yarn

yarn add -g create-react-app
```

![original](assets/firebase-bg.png)

---

# We will now create our new app.

So after we clone our git repository, we look at using create-react-app into our new directory

```
create-react-app myapp
```

---

We then go into our new directory and install all the dependencies we need

```
npm install material-ui@next react-router-dom whatwg-fetch --save

# or

yarn add material-ui@next react-router-dom whatwg-fetch
```

* We're using fetch polyfill here as `fetch` is built in natively into the browser, and it is not available for IE11 or prior
* We're also using the beta version of material-ui v1 (it will go GA Soon)

# Let's build a Unit Card First

```js
// src/components/RoomCard.js

import React from "react";
import { Card, CardMedia } from "material-ui";
import { CardContent } from "material-ui/Card";
import Typography from "material-ui/Typography";

export default function RoomCard({ roomCode, roomLocation, roomPicture }) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardMedia
        image={roomPicture}
        style={{
          height: 200
        }}
      />
      <CardContent>
        <Typography variant="subheading">{roomCode}</Typography>
        <Typography variant="title">{roomLocation}</Typography>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
