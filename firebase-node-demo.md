# Installing Create-React-App

CRA is a zero-configuration generator tool that can get us started up quickly

```
npm install -g create-react-app

# or if you are using yarn

yarn add -g create-react-app
```

# We will now create our new app.

So after we clone our git repository, we look at using create-react-app into our new directory

```
create-react-app myapp
```

We then go into our new directory and install all the depencies we need

```
npm install material-ui react-router-dom firebase firebase-admin --save

# or

yarn add material-ui react-router-dom firebase firebase-admin
```
