# Advanced Git

Well, working with teams üë™ may be hard. There is generally two ways you can work off a branch.

* Using Branches
* Using Forks

# Option 1: Use Branches üå≥ for Versioning Control

1.  Make a branch with the feature name or your own username
2.  Every time you commit and push up
3.  Make a Pull Request
4.  Merge the pull request

One of the best workflows is known as _GitFlow_

* **master**: branch is the key branch, everytime for release
* **develop**: _unstable_, most of the PRs should go here
* **'feature/\*'**, **'fix/\***, etc.: are 'for purpose' branches, these branches are for development
* **deploy** (not shown), is for **manual** deployments to prod

# Option 2: Using Forks üç¥ for Versioning Control

The best way to image a fork, is image a copy of the main repository that you own that you can _pull_, _merge_ and apply changes to.
