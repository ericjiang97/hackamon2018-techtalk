| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `git clone`  | Clones a repository locally            |
| `git add`    | Stages changes to file(s) for a commit |
| `git commit` | Creates a commit (set of changes)      |

# Advanced Git

Well, working with teams üë™ may be hard. There are generally two ways you can work off a repository.

* Using Branches
* Using Forks

## ![original](assets/background.png)

# Option 1: Use Branches üå≥ for Versioning Control

1.  Make a branch with the feature name or your own username
2.  Every time you commit and push up
3.  Make a Pull Request
4.  Merge the pull request

One of the best workflows is known as _GitFlow_

# GitFlow - Used with monPlan Git Workflow

* **master**: branch is the key branch, everytime for release
* **develop**: _unstable_, most of the PRs should go here
* **'feature/\*'**, **'fix/\***, etc.: are 'for purpose' branches, these branches are for development
* **deploy** (not shown), is for **manual** deployments to prod

# So how does it work?

# Create a branch

> ProTip: It's easier for your branch name to follow a simple pattern,typically we use something like fix/_, feature/_, refactor/\*

```shell
# we create a new branch
git branch feature/demo-branch
# we make the new branch the new working branch
git checkout feature/demo-branch
```

# Add Commits

## We make our changes and then

```
git add .
git commit -m "new commit"
git push
```

# Option 2: Using Forks üç¥ for Versioning Control

The best way to image a fork, is image a copy of the main repository that you own that you can _pull_, _merge_ and apply changes to.
